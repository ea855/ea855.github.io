Hey, this public journal starts with this first page. I am a CS student wanting to be the best I can be.
I will post here daily about my progress learning new technologies.
This month I want to know more about blockchain and crypto. Maybe even develop a small app.
But I also want to use this to force me to do the things I plan. In the past year I procrastinated a lot and that needs to stop.
So, until evening.

EA855.
