Hey, this public journal starts with this first page. I am a CS student wanting to be the best I can be.

I want to use this to force me to do the things I plan to do. In the past year I procrastinated a lot and that needs to stop.

I will also post here daily about my progress learning new technologies.
This month I want to know more about blockchain and crypto. Maybe even develop a small app.
