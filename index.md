What this is all about.
If anybody ever reads this, congrats, you just found my little blog. I will post here about my progress learning new things and being a better person.
I chose github pages to host this as it is the easiest. I also won't format this at all. I think the simplicity suits the purpose of this blog.
I try to post daily here.
